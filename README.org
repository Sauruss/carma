#+SEQ_TODO: MAYBE SOMEDAY BLOCKED TODO IN_PROGRESS | DONE

* Prerequisites
  - we aim at GHC 7.4.1 compatibility;
  
  - snap-0.7.1 is required (available in [[https://github.com/f-me/carma/downloads][Downloads]]);

  - Backbone 0.9.1 is included with backported [[https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/commit/a865aa41f13c371d104da9446c3ccb6a16671658][patch]] from upstream;

* Accounts

  Sample user db is included under `resources/private/users.json`.

  Available accounts:

  - admin @ <empty password>

  User management is available via [[https://github.com/dzhus/snap-auth-cli][snap-auth-cli]].
  
* To do
** IN_PROGRESS Provide case model
** IN_PROGRESS Tech assistance model
   - [ ] techType — dictionary
** IN_PROGRESS [0/3] Towage model
   - [ ] towerType & towType       — dictionaries
   - [ ] towDealer & towContractor — references
   - [ ] caseAddress & towAddress  — references
** TODO Provide dealer and partner models
   With proper field index annotations for redson search API.

** TODO Support references
   Perhaps referencables field should not be used at all (to support
   dynamic lists of referencable models)
** TODO Dictionaries
   Special field type (will replace `choice`?)
** TODO Client settings
   Some settings need to be served to client code (to use in JS):
   
    - serverSyncThrottle;
    - serverSyncDelay;
    - timelineUpdateInterval;

** IN_PROGRESS Indexed fields
   Fields should support "index" boolean attribute, in which case
   inverse index for that field should be created in Redis.

   Consider {"name": "code", "index": true} field for `scp` model,
   then if code field of model N is set to K, update must append N to
   `scp:code:K` to N. This will allow faster searching by field
   contents.
** MAYBE Better JavaScript tables solution
