#+SEQ_TODO: MAYBE SOMEDAY BLOCKED TODO IN_PROGRESS | DONE

* Prerequisites
  - we aim at GHC 7.4.1 compatibility;
  
  - snap-0.8 is required;

  - Backbone 0.9.1 is included with backported [[https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/commit/a865aa41f13c371d104da9446c3ccb6a16671658][patch]] from upstream;

  - Bootstrap is custom (source is a list of objects, source
    annotation is eval'd, show on click)
* Security

  Currently `transparent-mode` is `true` due to lack of ways to set
  field permissions on group fields.

  Sample user db is included under `resources/private/users.json`.

  Available accounts:

  - admin @ <empty password>

  User management is available via [[https://github.com/dzhus/snap-auth-cli][snap-auth-cli]].
