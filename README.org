#+SEQ_TODO: MAYBE SOMEDAY BLOCKED TODO IN_PROGRESS | DONE

* Prerequisites
  - we aim at GHC 7.4.1 compatibility;
  
  - snap-0.7.1 is required (available in [[https://github.com/f-me/carma/downloads][Downloads]]);

  - Backbone 0.9.1 is included with backported [[https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/commit/a865aa41f13c371d104da9446c3ccb6a16671658][patch]] from upstream;

* Security

  Currently `transparent-mode` is `true` due to lack of ways to set
  field permissions on group fields.

  Sample user db is included under `resources/private/users.json`.

  Available accounts:

  - admin @ <empty password>

  User management is available via [[https://github.com/dzhus/snap-auth-cli][snap-auth-cli]].
  
* To do
** IN_PROGRESS Provide case model
** TODO Address model
** TODO VIN model
** IN_PROGRESS [1/2] Tech assistance model
   - [X] techType — dictionary
   - [ ] techContractor & caseAddress — references
** IN_PROGRESS [1/3] Towage model
   - [X] towerType & towType       — dictionaries
   - [ ] towDealer & towContractor — references
   - [ ] caseAddress & towAddress  — references
** TODO Provide dealer and partner models
   With proper field index annotations for redson search API.

** IN_PROGRESS Support references
   Perhaps referencables field should not be used at all (to support
   dynamic lists of referencable models).

   Fix reference field mark to work everywhere.

   {{refField}}Ref observable cannot be used from the interface.
** MAYBE Generate navbar from screens description
** TODO [/] More client-side caching
   - [ ] templates;
   - [ ] models;
** IN_PROGRESS Dictionaries
   Special field type (will replace `choice`?)

   Must implement label←→value translation (at knockBackbone@main.js)

   Write data-api for jQuery Autocomplete as it's better.

   Show dictionary when field is focused.
** TODO Client settings
   Some settings need to be served to client code (to use in JS):
   
    - serverSyncThrottle;
    - serverSyncDelay;
    - timelineUpdateInterval;

** TODO Field contents are not saved if autocomplete menu is clicked
** MAYBE Better JavaScript tables solution
